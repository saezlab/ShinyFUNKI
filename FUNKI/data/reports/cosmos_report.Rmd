COSMOS is a tool to integrate multiomic data with a prior knowledge network spanning signaling, gene regulation and metabolism ( [Dugourd et al. 2021](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/33502086) ). It uses the ILP formulation of CARNIVAL to connect two sets of upstream and downstream molecular features (e.i. kinase activities, TF activities, deregulated metabolites, enzyme fluxes, genetic or drug perturbations, etcâ€¦) with a signed directed transomic network. 

This resulting network is essentially a set of coherent mechanistic hypotheses that can explain how the measured deregulation may explain each other. Subsets of this network centered on user-defined nodes can be viewed in the shiny app. The network can also be downloaded as a pair of sif and attribute csv files. These files can be imported in tools such as cytoscape to visualise the full network.

### The analysis

`r params$analysis_expl`

The **layer 1** was `r params$layer1`

The **layer 2** was `r params$layer2`

The **network** (_netObj_) was `r params$network`

The **solver** was `r params$solver`

#### The code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  carnival_result = runCARNIVAL( inputObj = iniciators,
                                 measObj = tfList, 
                                 netObj = cNET, 
                                 weightObj = progenylist, 
                                 solverPath = solver$spath, 
                                 solver = solver$solver,
                                 timelimit = 7200,
                                 mipGAP = 0,
                                 poolrelGAP = 0 )
```

### The results: Network visualisation

COSMOS produces a set of networks that can be directly visualised.
