## Save these in case I need to process this file again:
## Start by downloading this file: 
## http://www.UniProt.org/docs/speclist

## Then remove the header and footer

## then grep out lines for synonyms and  (with -v)
grep -v "C=" species1.txt > species2.txt
grep -v "S=" species2.txt > species3.txt

## then use perl one liners to clean up and extract information we want.
## perl -pe 's/(^.*):(.*)/$1\n/s' sList.txt > IDs.txt
## perl -pe 'tr/ /\t/s' IDs.txt > IDs2.txt

## In particular this one gets what we want (tax IDs with formal names):
perl -pe 's/^(.+)\W(.+)\W(.+): N=(.*)/$3\t$4/s' sList.txt > Names.txt
